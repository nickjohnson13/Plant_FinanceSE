Introduction
------------

The set of models contained in this Plant_FinanceSE software allow for the determination of wind plant cost of energy.  There are two turbine cost models included: 1) the NREL Costs and Scaling Model financial model (NREL_CSM_FIN) and 2) a more basic version of the above (Basic_Finance).  Both are based on the NREL Cost and Scaling Model :cite:`Fingersh2006`.

Plant_FinanceSE is implemented as an `OpenMDAO <http://openmdao.org/>`_ assembly.  All supporting code is also in OpenMDAO based on the Python programming language.
